          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4"></p>



<p class="text-white-50 mb-4">The team was formed from a group of Imperial students that enjoy cooking but own nothing more than a tiny kitchen. A problem arised when more condiments were bought but there was no space to store. Moreover, without a weighting scale, it was a quite a challenge to follow the exact recipe when learning how to cook new dishes</p>
<p class="text-white-50 mb-4">From the initial research, we found that there was very little development in products that can solve the problems specifically for those who own tiny kitchen, this made us want to be the pioneer innovators to fix the problems</p>
  <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">From discussion, we concluded that it was the right time to revolutionise the cooking experience, and make a newly innovative product to make the task more convenient, more economical use of space and more efficient use time </p>
<p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Inspired by bar taps, we suggest designing a multi-functional condiment dispenser that helps users select, measure and dispense different spices all at once. This not only saves the hassle created by confusing different spices but also saves the user kitchen space</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
          <p>There are 3 tools used in for the website design</p>
          <p>1. Github - It was selected because it supports website design by providing collaboration and code review for better codes, help to find the right tools and also help with project management while working as a team</p>
          <p>2. Atom - It was selected because it is a one of the most impactful desktop application built using web technologies. Most of the extending packages have free software licenses and are community-built and maintained which is very beneficial to develoers like us</p>
          <p>3. Bootstrap - Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. We used this for the template of our website to ensure great efficiency of work</p>

          <h3 class="mb-0">Steps for registering and setting up the domain name for the website</h3>
          <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
          <p>To set up a www or custom subdomain, such as www.example.com or blog.example.com, you must create a CNAME file in your site's repository and configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider. Below are the follwing steps</p>
        <p>1. On GitHub, navigate to your site's repository</p>
        <p>2. Under your repository name, click  Settings</p>
        <p>3. Under "Custom domain", type your custom domain, then click Save. This will create a commit that adds a CNAME file in the root of your publishing source.</p>
        <p>4. Navigate to your DNS provider and create a CNAME record that points your subdomain to the default domain for your site. For example, if you want to use the subdomain www.example.com for your user site, create a CNAME record that points www.example.com to <user>.github.io. For more information about how to create the correct record, see your DNS provider's documentation. For more information about the default domain for your site, see "About GitHub Pages."</p>
        <p>5. Open Git Bash.</p>
        <p>6. To confirm that your DNS record configured correctly, use the dig command, replacing WWW.EXAMPLE.COM with your subdomain.</p>
        <p>7. If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the CNAME file to your local repository. For more information, see "Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages."</p>
        <p>8. Optionally, to enable HTTPS encryption for your site, select Enforce HTTPS. It can take up to 24 hours before this option is available. For more information, see "Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS."</p>

            <p>1. Good usage of breathing room</p>

<p>3. Fast responses</p>
<p>4. Media queries</p></p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
          <p>There were 4 areas of consideration into making this website </p>
            <p>1. Consider the target audiences
              <p>Since our target audiences are household cooks, the design of the website was kept as simple as possible and focuses on functions of the  product rather than technical considerations</p>
<p>2. Consider our product</p>
  <p>Since there are difined uses of our product, the website was designed to make readers understand all the functions of our product as easy as possible</p>
<p>3. Consider the structure of the website</p>
  <p>To make the website easy and pleasing for the readers to read, the website was structured in the way categolises the same content in the same section </p>
<p>4. Consider the aims and objectives of this website</p>
  <p>The reason to make this website is to advertise to potential customers and tell them that this kind of product will be launched, so the website was designed to be as concise as possible where keeping the main messages in each section</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3">GDPR stands for General Data Protecton and Regulation which is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU)</div>
          <p>The These are the 12 consideration areas I have made (or should have made)on this website</p>
          <p>1. Raise awareness - by making sure that all of my team members aware of the existance of this website and GDPR</p>
          <p>2. Document everything- I should have documented the personal data that I hold such as my teamates photos</p>
          <p>3. Review current privacy notices - I should have explained the lawful basis for processing the data, data retention periods and that individuals have a right to complain to the ICO</p>
          <p>4. Check your rights for individuals - I should have ensured that my teamates cover all the rights individuals have which are the right to be informed;
the right of access;
the right to rectification;
the right to erasure;
the right to restrict processing;
the right to data portability;
the right to object; and
the right not to be subject to automated decision-making including profiling</p>
          <p>5. Review & update request procedures - I should have updated the procedures and plan how I will handle requests going forward</p>
          <p>6. Identify, document & explain lawful basis - I should have explained and documented the lawful basis </p>
          <p>7. Refresh existing consents - If we are using consent as a basis for processing and our existing consents do not meet the GDPR standard, I need to review how I seek, record and manage consent as soon as possible. </p>
          <p>8. Protect the data of children - since there is no invlovement of children aged below 16, this section is irrelevant to our website</p>
          <p>9. Detect, report & investigate breach of personal data - I should have put procedures in place to effectively detect, report and investigate a personal data breach</p>
          <p>10. Adopt an approach to privacy & data protection - I should have made a Data Protection Impact Assessment if the data processing is likely to result in high risk to individuals</p>
          <p>11. Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) - only consider this if we made ourself an organisation</p>
          <p>12. Determine your lead authority - only conside this if we decide to trade internationally</p>

          <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
          <p>This is the 4-step marketting strategy I would make to drive people to the website</p>
          <p>1. Share links to the website using social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter – start by sharing to friends and family and try to encourage them to share to others to get initial customer base.</p>
          <p>2. Create pages and advertise through social media – create a page dedicated to the product to advertise the product and website. Invest some money in advertising through social media is a good idea since it would reach our target customers easier with low costs.</p>
          <p>3. Advertise our product through start-up or innovation events – this is a good way to make people know more about our product and website. It also attracts potential investors.</p>
          <p>4. Invest in advertising via search platforms – advertise our website through google, yahoo and bink and pay some money to make our website be at the top of the screen when people search for kitchen tool.</p>
